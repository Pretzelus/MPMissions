DAC_Logic INTERN + Basic settings
\n\nThe file ""DAC_Config_Creator"" is to be used to adjust the basic settings of DAC.
\n\nYou arent forced to back up this config-file to adjust the settings. It´s possible to call or even adjust these basic parameters e.g. easily with a further Logic-unit.
\n\nThis Mission is an example about this. This will represent how I call some basic parameters easily by using a Logic-unit.
\n\nThis way provides the big advantage to adjust these settings directly in the editor exept using external files.
\n\nTake a deep look at the file ""DAC_Config_Creator"" and the ""Readme"", to see which settings are possible to adjust by using this possibility.
\n\nInformation: Only the half of all basic settings were used in this Mission.
