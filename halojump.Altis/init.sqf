Enemy forces are large in the region, and holding position for too long will get you killed, either by encirclement or getting overpowered with enemy fire.

Once on a ground, you are allowed to use every resource given to gain advantage over the enemy. Good luck out there."]];

ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons, use ID-tagged gear. Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control. Information control. Emotion control. Battlefield control. Everything is monitored and kept under control.<br/>War has changed. The age of deterrence has become the age of control...All in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield...controls history. War has changed. When the battlefield is under total control...War becomes routine. ~Solid Snake, MGS4<br/><br/>For this mission you are given transport plane C-130J and two armed Little Birds."]];
